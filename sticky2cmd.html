           <h1>Sticky2CMD</h1>
           <h2>Note: Sticky2CMD is property of MindFire Technologies.</h2>
           <h3>Created by: Christopher Richardson</h3>

           <p>
            Sticky2CMD is a neat little bad USB, that once plugged into a PC that is booted into WinRE with command prompt open, runs a script that creates a back-up of sethc.exe, deletes sethc.exe, copies command prompt and then renames the copied command prompt to sethc.exe.
           Once this process is finished, the user then restarts the PC, loads into the lockscreen then plugs in the bad USB. The USB then emulates 5 shift key presses to trigger sethc.exe which opens command prompt within the lockscreen environment.
           Once the command prompt is triggered, it then runs a script which automates the process of creating a local account, then once created attributes the local account to the administrators group, ultimately creating a sort of "backdoor" into the system. The USB can be modified
           to run a script that edits the registry keys to hide this local admin account, making the account a ghost account. (though in its current state this modifcation does not exist on Sticky2CMD, but is possible.). The scripts are controlled & executed by a simple button press,
           as you can see in the photos above, there are no buttons attached. This Sticky2CMD board in particular was naked at the time of these photos, but using a wire or simple paper clip, pressing one end onto your skin (ground) and the other onto the button header on the board
           simulates a button press. On this particular Sticky2CMD board, button 2 was responsible for WinRE Sticky2CMD automation, Button 4 was responsible for sethc/cmd.exe admin account creation automation.
