                <h3>My Desire To Learn, My History & My Goals</h3>
                <p>Since an early teenager discovering the complexity of technology I have always strived to learn more. The volatility of the tech industry has always intrigued me. 
                As a young teenager I first began with hardware, modifying the look of consoles such as the Xbox 360 & learning how to solder and apply plexi glass. After 2 years
                of console hardware modification I discovered the broad range of possibilities with computers and decided to get one. I quickly fell in love with everything computers
                from the software to the hardware, I quickly jumped into learning how to program, beginning with C# and Unity to create small games, eventually leading up to creating
                .NET framework applications. After many years of programming I quickly realized I needed to get into the hardware side of things. I ordered all the parts to build my
                first computer and it was a success! I fell in love with the reality that there are essentially endless possbilities in regards to building a computer! I currently do
                build computers professionally under my own sole proprietorship. I constantly have a desire to learn more within the technology industry, eager to learn the innerworkings
                of newly released technology, the specifications of such devices & source code aswell. I also love reverse engineering viruses and have experience in malware, I know how rootkit
                (RAT) viruses work aswell as keyloggers, ransomware, spyware, trojans and adware. I always set personal goals to strive within the workplace, to be the best out of my
                colleagues, to set new standards and records within the business I am presently tied to and to push the organization to new heights. Since my understanding of viruses 
                I have grown to fall in love with the world of Cybersecurity. From hashes, steganography, network penetration, & web application vulnerabilities, I have grown to love it all.
                I have a never ending desire to learn more and the landscape of Cybersecurity is ever-changing due to ever-changing threats. I am excited to push forward in this field and continue
                to learn more.</p>
